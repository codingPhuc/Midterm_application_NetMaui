# Application Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have an internet connection on your device and the .NET MAUI or Windows Machine installed. You can learn more about the installation process [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/maui/first-app-tutorial/intro).

## Project Structure:
In the source code folder, there are two directories: `MidtermProject` and `API_Essay`. The `API_Essay` is a REST API of Node.js and is included to demonstrate the server's operation. The `MidtermProject` is the .NET MAUI project that you need to open with an IDE that supports .NET MAUI, such as Microsoft Visual Studio.

## Running the Application:
Open your preferred IDE (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio).
- Navigate to the project directory and locate the `MidtermProject`.
- Start the application.

## Login Interface:
Once the application has started, you will see two fields in the login interface: `Email` and `Password`.
- In the `Email` field, enter `admin@`.
- In the `Password` field, enter `admin`.
You can also sign up in the sign-up interface to set your own email and password.

Please note that the application may run slowly when first started due to server lag. It is recommended to wait 5 to 8 seconds for the application to fully load.
